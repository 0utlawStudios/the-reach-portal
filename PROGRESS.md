# The Reach Clone Progress

Phase: Phase 2 slice 2 complete - Supabase/env rebind
Last SHA: dfcab7a
Next: Commit/push Supabase slice, then rebrand bounded user-facing strings/assets/domain references and central palette tokens.
Blockers: `supabase db diff --linked` could not run because Docker is not running locally. `supabase db push --dry-run --include-all --yes` reports the remote database is up to date.

Supabase slice notes:

- `.env.local` now points to Supabase ref `gxmpmdhmxyfqusdzcemt`, has `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=gxmpmdhmxyfqusdzcemt`, has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://reach.ten80ten.com`, and has `STUDIO_ENABLED=false` because real Creator Studio/OpenAI values were not provided.
- SMTP values match the Ten80Ten env byte-for-byte by hash.
- Supabase is linked to the new ref and all 33 migrations `0000` through `0032` are applied.
- Migration ordering fixes were required for a fresh clone: `0002` no longer references enum labels before `0005`, and `0005` now adds the role labels consumed by `0022`.
- Baseline workspace remains `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` and is labeled `The Reach / the-reach`.
- Buckets verified: `avatars`, `support-attachments`, and private `ai-assets`.
- Realtime verified on `posts` and `content_plan_rows`.
- RLS verified enabled on `posts`, `media_assets`, `post_comments`, `audit_log_v2`, and `content_plan_rows`.
- Post safety/publisher triggers verified: `posts_audit_before_delete`, `posts_protect_approved_and_posted`, `posts_audit_stage_change`, and `posts_block_manual_posted`.

Safety notes:

- `src/lib/pipeline-context.tsx` must remain untouched.
- Baseline workspace UUID remains `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`.
- Do not commit secrets.
- Do not fabricate Supabase refs, Drive IDs, social handles, OpenAI keys, or brand hex values.
